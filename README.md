## Purpose

During our time at Turing School of Software & Design we were expected to create various projects that challenged our programming skills as we learned more and more. Turing School of Software & Design splits their intensive ~7 month program into what they call "modules". Each module focuses on increasingly more advanced programming concepts, starting with the simple task of learning `Ruby`. During module 1 we were given the task of creating an applicaiton which could process several CSV files of more than 10,000 lines.

In this project we learned how to use TDD in a way that produced the most benefit by creating classes which would create an object of each line of CSV code, making the objects easier to manage than just parsing the CSV files line by line. We also had to learn how to use `PostgreSQL` and it's accompanying commands to calculate various endpoints, rather than using in-built `Ruby` methods which would've increased the processing time to an unfeasible amount.
